A sitting unit has been created inspired through the public stairs. Various different sitting areas can be constructed.

Multiple combinations can be made by using more than one units, and they can easily be altered.  

In addition, the sitting unit can be used as a table thanks to the cover apparatus located next to it. You can put the **Epysode** in an upright position and place the cover apparatus in the holes and use it as a table.
