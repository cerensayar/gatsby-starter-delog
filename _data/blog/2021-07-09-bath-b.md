Bath-b was designed in search for better appearance and functionality in the bathroom. Usually the bristles of a brush do not look pretty. Bath-b only shows its bristles when used.

It is a brush for cleaning the sink, bathtub etc. Thanks to its special mechanism; when you want to use the brush, you take out the bristles by means of pushing a button. When not used, the bristles are not visible.

After use, it draws in the brushes with the help of a button to filter out excess water in the bristles and eliminates the ugly look.
